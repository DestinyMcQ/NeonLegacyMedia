            <h2>How this started</h2>
            <p>
        We met as coworkers in the same office. Often neurodivergent in the same ways, we learned how our individual skills compliment one another and how good of a team that we made. Then we learned that both of us had dreamed of starting a marketing company before we had even met. After literally like a year of talk, we actually started to work on it. Just creating mock-ups and brainstorming what our roles would be. Over time it got more fleshed out, we had a logo, and a name, and soon a website. We know that a lot of businesses start in the same way. Just an idea between friends, we want to use our experience to help you with the back end of getting your business off the ground and into the eyes of your target audience.

                I started college at BCTC about a year and a half after graduating high school. I was told by everyone in my life that taking a gap year would be a mistake and if I did, I wouldn't end up ever getting my degree, but once I graduated high school, I had NO IDEA what I wanted to do now. If I had gone to college I would have no idea what my major was going to be. I thought about just taking pre-recs to get them out of the way but it didn't feel right to me. In that year and a half I tried a few things and changed what I said my major would be a few times. Finally settling on graphic design, as it was the only thing I enjoyed enough to be worth going to college for. I did all my pre-rec classes first. I still wanted to give myself time because I thought I would change my mind. Then after working as a janitor at my college for about a year since it paid for my classes, I got a job as an admin for a college readiness program within the college. This still covered all my classes but now I was doing work I enjoyed. I was managing the social media, and making all worksheets, flyers, presentations, and everything else that we needed and it cemented that my passion was in graphic design. When Jordin and I realized that we both wanted to be in marketing, it just made sense for us to start the business together.
